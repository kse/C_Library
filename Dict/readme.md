Dictionary implementation
=========================

An implementation of a simple dictionary, that allows you to insert a bunch of
strings, and quickly check if the string exists in the dataset.

This consumes quite a bit more space than the list you insert. Some
minimization could be implemented, but for the dataset i used, it wouldnt've
made much difference.
